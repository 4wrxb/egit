# TODOs

## Current Branch

## Future goals

- Check-out a branch based on .egit.conf (how to handle non-clone ops? especially w/poor branch management)
- Add better documentation for setting up an egit repo
- Support references in the clone
- Add a "cleanup" script/command?
- Support gitk commands
- Handle access issues in egit_work etc.
- Research & document handling of branches (lots of problems, especially with remotes & merges)
